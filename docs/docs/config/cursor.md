## Cursor

By default, the cursor shape is set to `block`. You can also choose from other options like `underline` and `beam`.

Additionally, you can enable or disable cursor blinking, which is set to `false` by default.

```toml
[cursor]
shape = 'block'    # Options: 'block', 'underline', 'beam'
blinking = false   # Enable/disable blinking (default: false)
```
